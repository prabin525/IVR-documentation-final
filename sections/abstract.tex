\section*{ABSTRACT}


This report represents the report on a project entitled "Interactive Voice Response System with Speech Recognition" as a part of the curriculum for the final year project of B.E. in Computer Engineering. The report discusses various methods and implementation techniques to build the system of IVR system with speech recognition and presents the results of the system being implemented. \\
The project entitled "Interactive Voice Response System with Speech Recognition" is an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system with the capability of Speech Recognition. The project focuses on a system where the user interacts with the system with his/her voice and on the basis of the user's voice input the system performs various actions as a response to the voice command.It is an approach to make use of the voice of the user to recognize the given command.The project is helpful for various large organizations where there are many call queries or for telecommunications companies or other business ventures where user queries through their voice online or via cellular connections.  The prime focus of the project is to develop an application environment whereby users speech request are being processed for further task accomplishment as per the request.The final system being developed is a system being capable to take a real time voice input from a user under certain domain range and in response the system performs a task related to input.
